        <p class="jasmineBio">Hello! I am a third year Gaming Interactive Media Mobile student at Boise State
            University. I have been working on
            building and expanding my skills to go into media development. I am also working towards graduating with an
            ITM minor and
            am a part of the Honors College.
            <br />
            As a child I always knew I wanted to do something creative with my life, and I always thought I would go
            somewhere
            into the art field. However, the GIMM program showed me the amazing world of programming and game design,
            and now I
            want to create in a different format.
            <br />
            My major passion is game design, and I hope to one day work in Game Development.
